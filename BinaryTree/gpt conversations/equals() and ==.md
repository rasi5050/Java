# why this check doesnt need equals()
  
# if (current.getLeft()==null)

In the statement:

```java
if (current.getLeft() == null)
```

This check does **not** require the use of `.equals()` because you're comparing the object reference `current.getLeft()` to `null`. Here's why:

### 1. **`==` vs `equals()`**
- **`==`**: The `==` operator checks if **two references point to the exact same object** in memory (or if a reference is `null`). It checks **reference equality**.
- **`.equals()`**: The `.equals()` method is used to check **logical equality** between two objects, which means that two different objects could be considered "equal" based on their content, even if they are not the same reference.

### Why `== null` Works:
In this case, you're comparing `current.getLeft()` (a reference to the left child node) with `null`. This is a **reference comparison**, where you're checking whether the left child node is **not pointing to any object** (i.e., it's `null`).

- **`== null`** is the correct way to check if an object reference is `null` in Java.
- `.equals()` is not necessary in this context because `null` is a special value that refers to "no object," and you are simply checking if the reference is pointing to nothing.

### Why `equals()` Is Not Used with `null`:
- **`null` is not an object**, so calling `.equals()` on `null` would cause a `NullPointerException`.
- You should use `==` to compare a reference to `null` because `==` checks whether the reference is pointing to an object or not.

### Example:

```java
Node leftNode = current.getLeft();

if (leftNode == null) {
    // This checks if leftNode is null (no object reference)
}
```

In this case, using `==` is the correct approach, as you're checking if the reference itself is `null`. There's no need for `.equals()` because you're not comparing the content or state of objects — you're only checking if a reference is `null`.

### When You Use `.equals()`:
You use `.equals()` when you need to compare the **content** of two objects rather than their references. For example:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");

if (str1.equals(str2)) {
    // This checks if the content of str1 and str2 is the same (logical equality).
}
```

In this case, `str1` and `str2` refer to **different objects** in memory, but their content is the same, so `.equals()` would return `true`.

### Summary:
- **`== null`** is used to check if a reference points to no object (i.e., is `null`).
- You do **not** need `.equals()` to compare a reference to `null`.
- **`==`** checks reference equality, which is appropriate for comparing references to `null`.

# so can i say that if both the values compared are definitive u can use == ?

No, you cannot always use `==` when comparing two objects, even if both values are "definitive" (i.e., non-`null`). Here's why:

### 1. **`==` Checks Reference Equality, Not Value Equality**
- **`==`** compares whether two references point to the **same object** in memory.
- **`.equals()`** compares the **content** (or logical equality) of two objects, even if they are different objects in memory.

Thus, just because two variables are "definitive" (i.e., non-`null`), it doesn't mean you should use `==` to compare them. You need to decide whether you care about **reference equality** or **logical equality**.

### When Should You Use `==`?
- **For primitive types** (e.g., `int`, `char`, `boolean`), use `==` to compare values because primitive types are compared by value.
  ```java
  int a = 5;
  int b = 5;
  if (a == b) {
      // This checks if a and b have the same value (true)
  }
  ```

- **For reference types**, use `==` if you need to compare whether two variables **point to the same object** (i.e., reference equality).
  ```java
  Node node1 = new Node(10);
  Node node2 = node1;
  if (node1 == node2) {
      // This checks if node1 and node2 refer to the same object (true)
  }
  ```

- **When checking against `null`**, use `==` because you are checking whether the reference points to no object.
  ```java
  if (node1 == null) {
      // This checks if node1 is null (true if it is)
  }
  ```

### When Should You Use `.equals()`?
- **For object comparison**: Use `.equals()` when you want to compare the **content** or **logical equality** of two objects, even if they are distinct objects in memory.
  ```java
  String str1 = new String("Hello");
  String str2 = new String("Hello");
  if (str1.equals(str2)) {
      // This checks if str1 and str2 have the same content (true)
  }
  ```

In this case, `==` would return `false` because `str1` and `str2` are different objects in memory, but `.equals()` returns `true` because their contents are the same.

### Example: `==` vs. `.equals()` for Objects
Consider the following code:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");

if (str1 == str2) {
    System.out.println("References are the same");  // This won't print
}

if (str1.equals(str2)) {
    System.out.println("Contents are the same");    // This will print
}
```

- `str1 == str2` compares references and returns `false` because `str1` and `str2` point to different objects.
- `str1.equals(str2)` compares the contents and returns `true` because both `str1` and `str2` contain the same string `"Hello"`.

### Summary:
- Use **`==`** to compare **primitive types** or to check if two references point to the **same object**.
- Use **`.equals()`** to compare the **content** (or logical equality) of two objects.
- Even if both values are "definitive" (non-`null`), use **`==`** for reference comparison and **`.equals()`** for value/content comparison.

<h1> so can i say that to use ==, both objects has to point to the same object or same refference.

by that logic can i say in 1==1, 1 is actually an object in memory refference and there will refferences for all numbers?
</h1>

Let's clarify both points.

### 1. **Using `==` for Objects**:
Yes, for **reference types (objects)** in Java, when you use `==`, it checks whether both references point to the **same object** in memory.

- If two references point to the same object in memory, `==` will return `true`.
- If they point to different objects (even if the content of those objects is identical), `==` will return `false`.

For example:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");

System.out.println(str1 == str2);   // false, because they are different objects
System.out.println(str1.equals(str2));  // true, because their content is the same
```

Here, `str1` and `str2` are different objects with the same content, so `==` returns `false` (because they don’t reference the same object), while `.equals()` returns `true` (because their contents are the same).

### 2. **Primitives and `==` (e.g., `1 == 1`)**:
For **primitive types** (like `int`, `double`, `char`), `==` works differently. It compares the **actual values** and **not references**.

- In the case of `1 == 1`, the number `1` is not an object in memory. It's a **primitive value**.
- Java stores **primitive values** directly, without references or object overhead, so `1 == 1` simply compares the two **numerical values**.

In this example:

```java
int a = 1;
int b = 1;

System.out.println(a == b);  // true, because the values of a and b are the same
```

Here, `a` and `b` are **primitive integers**, and `==` compares their **values** directly, not references.

### Are Numbers Objects in Memory?
No, primitive numbers like `1`, `2`, `3`, etc., in Java are **not objects** and don't have references like objects do. They are **primitive types** (e.g., `int`, `double`), and they are stored **directly in memory**.

However, when you work with **boxed types** (like `Integer`), the situation changes. Boxed types are **objects**, and `==` behaves differently with them.

For example:

```java
Integer num1 = 1;   // Auto-boxing converts primitive 1 to an Integer object
Integer num2 = 1;

System.out.println(num1 == num2);   // true, because of Integer caching for small values
System.out.println(num1.equals(num2));  // true, because their content is the same
```

Java has an **Integer cache** for small values (typically `-128` to `127`), so `num1 == num2` can return `true` for values in that range. However, for larger values, Java will create new `Integer` objects:

```java
Integer num1 = 128;
Integer num2 = 128;

System.out.println(num1 == num2);   // false, because they are different objects
System.out.println(num1.equals(num2));  // true, because their content is the same
```

### Summary:

- **For objects**: `==` checks if two references point to the same object.
- **For primitives**: `==` compares the **actual values** (like `1 == 1` compares two numerical values, not references).
- **Primitives are not objects**, and they don't have references. They are simple values stored directly in memory.
- **Boxed types** like `Integer` are objects, and `==` compares references (not values), while `.equals()` compares the values.


<h1>
so can i conclude

obj1 = new object()

obj2 = obj1

obj1.changeSomething();

return obj1==obj2

does it return True?
</h1>

Yes, your conclusion is correct! In the scenario you provided:

```java
Object obj1 = new Object();  // Creates a new object
Object obj2 = obj1;          // obj2 now refers to the same object as obj1

obj1.changeSomething();      // Change something in the object that both obj1 and obj2 refer to

return obj1 == obj2;         // This returns true
```

### Explanation:

1. **`Object obj1 = new Object();`**: This creates a new object in memory and assigns its reference to `obj1`.

2. **`Object obj2 = obj1;`**: This assigns the reference held by `obj1` to `obj2`. Both `obj1` and `obj2` now refer to the **same object** in memory.

3. **`obj1.changeSomething();`**: If `obj1` modifies the object (e.g., changes its state or calls a method), the same changes will be visible to `obj2` because both `obj1` and `obj2` point to the **same object**.

4. **`obj1 == obj2`**: This compares the **references** of `obj1` and `obj2`. Since both `obj1` and `obj2` point to the same object, the result of this comparison is `true`.

### Key Point:
- The `==` operator checks whether `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the **same memory location** (i.e., the same object). In this case, both `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the same object, so `obj1 == obj2` will return `true`.

### Example in Java:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj1 = new Object();
        Object obj2 = obj1;

        // Modify the object through obj1 (if it had a method)
        // obj1.someMethod();

        // Check if obj1 and obj2 are the same reference
        System.out.println(obj1 == obj2);  // This will print true
    }
}
```

In this case, since `obj1` and `obj2` refer to the **same object**, the comparison `obj1 == obj2` will return `true`.
