## We have all these types because java is statically types, like Function, Consumer, optional. Etc. then why don't use var instead , then java can find itself what is required right ? 

The `var` keyword in Java (introduced in Java 10) allows for **local variable type inference**, meaning that the compiler can determine the type of a local variable based on the context in which it is used. However, using `var` does not eliminate the need for types like `Function`, `Consumer`, `Optional`, etc., because `var` and these types serve different purposes.

### Understanding `var` in Java

1. **Type Inference with `var`:**
   - When you use `var`, the compiler infers the type of the variable based on the right-hand side of the assignment. For example:
   ```java
   var number = 5;          // Infers `int`
   var text = "Hello";      // Infers `String`
   var list = new ArrayList<String>();  // Infers `ArrayList<String>`
   ```

2. **Scope of `var`:**
   - `var` can only be used for **local variables** within a method or a block. It cannot be used for fields (class-level variables), method parameters, or return types.
   - The type inferred by `var` is still **static and known at compile-time**. It does not introduce dynamic typing; it merely reduces the verbosity of declaring a variable's type.

### Why `var` Doesn't Replace Types Like `Function`, `Consumer`, `Optional`, etc.

Let's explore why types like `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Optional` are still necessary even though `var` provides some level of type inference.

1. **`var` is Not Dynamic Typing:**
   - Java is a **statically-typed language**, meaning that all types must be known at compile time. `var` provides **local type inference** but does not make Java dynamically typed. The compiler still determines the exact type of the variable at compile time.
   - When you use `var`, you are not removing the type; you're just allowing the compiler to infer the type for you. This does not mean Java can automatically determine which type of function or consumer to use.

2. **`Function`, `Consumer`, and Other Functional Interfaces Define Behavior:**
   - Types like `Function`, `Consumer`, and other functional interfaces define **specific behavior contracts** that must be fulfilled. They provide a way to specify what kind of function is expected in a particular context (e.g., a function that takes an `Integer` and returns a `String`).
   - These interfaces are essential for Java's functional programming model. They enable you to use lambda expressions and method references by defining clear interfaces that describe what a lambda or method reference must look like (e.g., input and output types).
   - `var` cannot define behavior; it only infers the type of a local variable. You still need these types to define what a lambda expression or method reference should do.

3. **`Optional` and Type-Safety:**
   - `Optional` is not just a type that can be inferred; it is a **utility type** that encapsulates a value that might be present or absent. It provides methods (`isPresent`, `orElse`, `map`, etc.) to handle the presence or absence of a value safely.
   - The concept of an `Optional` value is not something that `var` can infer or replace. `Optional` provides a way to express optionality explicitly in the API, and its methods enforce type-safe handling of absent values.

4. **`var` Cannot Replace Specific Type Requirements:**
   - Even if you use `var`, you must still declare variables of specific functional types (like `Function` or `Consumer`) where required. For example:
   ```java
   var function = (Function<Integer, String>) i -> "Number: " + i;
   ```
   - Here, `var` infers the type `Function<Integer, String>`, but you still need to specify what the lambda does (accepts an `Integer` and returns a `String`).
   - The type inference provided by `var` is limited to the context of the assignment and does not remove the need for explicit type declarations in method signatures, fields, or APIs.

5. **`var` and Readability:**
   - Using `var` everywhere can actually reduce readability in some cases because it hides the actual type, making it harder for someone reading the code to immediately understand what type a variable is. For example:
   ```java
   var result = someMethodCall();
   ```
   - The type of `result` is now less clear without knowing what `someMethodCall()` returns. In contrast:
   ```java
   Optional<String> result = someMethodCall();
   ```
   - Here, the type is explicitly known, and you immediately understand that `result` is an `Optional<String>`.

### Example: Why `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Optional` Are Still Needed

Here's a practical example that demonstrates why you still need these types even with `var`:

```java
import java.util.function.Consumer;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.Optional;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using var for type inference
        var printConsumer = (Consumer<String>) s -> System.out.println(s);
        var intToStringFunction = (Function<Integer, String>) i -> "Number: " + i;

        // Applying the Consumer and Function
        printConsumer.accept("Hello, Java!");  // Prints: Hello, Java!
        String result = intToStringFunction.apply(42);  // Transforms 42 to "Number: 42"
        System.out.println(result);  // Prints: Number: 42

        // Handling Optional with type inference
        Optional<String> optionalValue = Optional.of("Hello");
        var value = optionalValue.orElse("Default");  // Inferred as String
        System.out.println(value);  // Prints: Hello
    }
}
```

- In this example:
  - **`Consumer` and `Function`** are still needed to define the behavior of the lambda expressions.
  - **`Optional`** is used to handle the potential absence of a value.
  - **`var`** provides type inference for the local variables (`printConsumer`, `intToStringFunction`, `value`), but it does not eliminate the need for `Consumer`, `Function`, and `Optional`.

### Summary

- **`var`** is useful for local type inference, making code less verbose without sacrificing type safety.
- However, **`var` does not eliminate the need** for types like `Function`, `Consumer`, `Optional`, etc., because:
  - Java is still a statically-typed language that requires knowing types at compile-time.
  - These types define specific behaviors, contracts, and utility methods that cannot be replaced by simple type inference.
  - `var` is for convenience and readability in local contexts, not for replacing Java's static typing system or the need for functional interfaces and utility classes.
